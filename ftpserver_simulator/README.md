This is a FTP server that simulates the behavior of the FTP. To run it:

1. Make sure you place the script configuration file "simulated_server_config.json" in the same directory as the script.  
2. Change the simulated_server_config.json per your need.  
3. This server uses the detaul FTP port 21. So make sure that the port 21 on your machine is NOT being used.   
4. Script running syntax:  

      **python simulated_server.py -c simulated_server_config.json**
